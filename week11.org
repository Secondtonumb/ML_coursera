* Photo OCR
** Problem Description and Pipeline
人工数据合成 /artificial data synthesis/
+ Text detection
+ Character segmentation
+ Character classification
还有拼写矫正等功能C1eaning -> Cleaning
** 机器学习流水线
Image -> Text detection -> Character segmenatation -> Character recognition
* Sliding Windows 滑动窗
+ Text detection
+ Pedestrain detection
+ Spervised learning for pedestrain detection
1d Sliding window for character segmentation
使用滑动窗来进行文字检测
/expantion 展开器/
*** Photo OCR pipeline
+ Text detection 文本检出
+ Character segmantation 字符分析
+ Character classification 字符鉴别
* Getting Lots of Data and Artificial Data 人工数据合成
** 白手起家 
** 扩充数据集
** Speech recognition
+ Original audio -> add noise
** Discusstion on getting more data
+ Make sure you have a low bias classifier before expending the effort.(Plot learning curves.) \
E.g. keep increasing the number of features/ numver of hidden untits in neural network untill you have a low bias classifier
+ How much work would it be to get 10x as much data as we currently have
  + ARtificial data synthesi
  + Collect/label it yourself ->　算算到底有没有意义
　+ "Crowd source" (E.g. Anazon Mechanical Turk)
* Ceiling Analysis: What Part of the Pipeline to Work on Next 上限分析
时间十分重要,要决定好下一步到底做什么
